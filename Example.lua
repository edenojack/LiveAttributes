    FOV 30                  --> we created an attribute for this before-the-fact, so it will respect our initial value!
    Position 0, 0, 0        --> An attribute will exist for this
    TestAttribute  â–¶ {...}  --> No attribute will exist for this, as it's not a valid Attribute type!

  With this now set up, anytime after this point where you reference something such as;

  ThisConfig.Difficulty

  You will *always* recieve the most up to date version of it. You can change it via code, you can change it via Attributes, it should always be up to date.
